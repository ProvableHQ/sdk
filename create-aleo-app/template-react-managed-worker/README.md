# React + Aleo + Managed Worker

> [!NOTE]  
> This is an experimental template not recommended for use

This template provides a minimal setup to get React and Aleo working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Note: Webpack is currently used for production builds due to a [bug](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13367) with Vite related to nested workers.
