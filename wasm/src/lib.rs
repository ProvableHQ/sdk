//! # Aleo Wasm
//!
//! Aleo JavaScript and WebAssembly bindings for building zero-knowledge web applications.
//!
//! `Rust` compiles easily to `WebAssembly` but creating the glue code necessary to use compiled WebAssembly binaries
//! from other languages such as JavaScript is a challenging task. `wasm-bindgen` is a tool that simplifies this process by
//! auto-generating JavaScript bindings to Rust code that has been compiled into WebAssembly.
//!
//! This crate uses `wasm-bindgen` to create JavaScript bindings to Aleo source code so that it can be used to create zero
//! knowledge proofs directly within `web browsers` and `NodeJS`.
//!
//! Functionality exposed by this crate includes:
//! * Aleo account management objects
//! * Aleo primitives such as `Records`, `Programs`, and `Transactions` and their associated helper methods
//! * A `ProgramManager` object that contains methods for authoring, deploying, and interacting with Aleo programs
//!
//! More information on these concepts can be found at the [Aleo Developer Hub](https://developer.aleo.org/concepts).
//!
//! ## Usage
//! The [wasm-pack](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-pack) tool is used to compile the Rust code in this crate into JavaScript
//! modules which can be imported into other JavaScript projects.
//!
//! #### Install Wasm-Pack
//! ```bash
//! curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh
//! ```
//!
//! ### Build Instructions
//! The general syntax for compiling rust into WebAssembly based JavaScript modules with
//! [wasm-pack](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-pack) is as follows:
//! ```bash
//! wasm-pack build --target <target> --out-dir <out-dir> -- --features <crate-features>
//! ```
//!
//! Invoking this command will build a JavaScript module in the current directory with the default name `pkg` (which can
//! be changed as necessary using the `--out-dir` flag). This folder can then be imported directly as a JavaScript module
//! by other JavaScript modules.
//!
//! There are 3 possible JavaScript modules that [wasm-pack](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-pack) can be used to generate
//! when run within this crate:
//! 1. **NodeJS module:** Used to build NodeJS applications.
//! 2. **Single-Threaded browser module:** Used to build browser-based web applications.
//! 3. **Multi-Threaded browser module:** Used to build browser-based web applications which use web-worker based
//! multi-threading to achieve significant performance increases.
//!
//! These 3 modules and how to build them are explained in more detail below.
//!
//! ### 1. NodeJS Module
//!
//! This module has the features of the NodeJS environment built-in. It is single-threaded and unfortunately cannot yet be
//! used to generate Aleo program executions or deployments due to current Aleo protocol limitations. It can however still
//! be used to perform Aleo account, record, and program management tasks.
//!
//! #### Build Instructions
//! ```bash
//! wasm-pack build --release --target nodejs -- --features "serial" --no-default-features
//! ```
//!
//! ### 2. Single-Threaded browser module
//!
//! This module is very similar to the NodeJS module, however it is built to make use browser-based JavaScript environments
//! and can be used for program execution and deployment.
//!
//! If used for program execution or deployment, it suggested to do so on a web-worker as these operations are long-running
//! and will cause a browser window to hang if run in the main thread.
//!
//! #### Build Instructions
//! ```bash
//! wasm-pack build --release --target web
//! ```
//!
//! If you are intending to use this for program execution or deployment, it is recommended to build
//! with maximum or close to maximum memory allocation (which is 4 gigabytes for wasm).
//!
//! ```bash
//! RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=--max-memory=4294967296' wasm-pack build --release --target web
//! ````
//!
//! ### 3. Multi-Threaded browser module
//!
//! This module is also built for browser-based JavaScript environments, however it is built to make use of Rust-native
//! threading via web-workers (using the approach outlined in the `rayon-wasm-bindgen` crate). It is the most complex to use,
//! but it will run significantly faster when performing Aleo program executions and deployments and should be the choice for
//! performance-critical applications.
//!
//! To build with threading enabled, it is necessary to use `nightly Rust` and set certain `RUSTFLAGS` to enable the
//! necessary threading features. The `wasm-pack` build command is shown below.
//! ```bash
//! # Set rustflags to enable atomics,
//! # bulk-memory, and mutable-globals.
//! # Also, set the maximum memory to
//! # 4294967296 bytes (4GB).
//! export RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory,+mutable-globals -C link-arg=--max-memory=4294967296'
//!
//! # Use rustup to run the following commands
//! # with the nightly version of Rust.
//! rustup run nightly \
//!
//! # Use wasm-pack to build the project.
//! # Specify the 'parallel' feature for
//! # multi-threading and the 'browser'
//! # feature to enable program execution
//! # and include necessary unstable options
//! # using -Z
//! wasm-pack build --release --target web --out-dir pkg-parallel \
//! -- --features "parallel, browser" -Z build-std=panic_abort,std
//! ```
//!
//! ## Testing
//!
//! Run tests in NodeJS
//! ```bash
//! wasm-pack test --node
//! ```
//!
//! Run tests in a browser
//! ```bash
//! wasm-pack test --[firefox/chrome/safari]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Building Web Apps
//!
//! Further documentation and tutorials as to how to use the modules built from this crate to build web apps  will be built
//! in the future. However - in the meantime, the [provable.tools](https://provable.tools) website is a good
//! example of how to use these modules to build a web app. Its source code can be found in the
//!
